To add tests in here, please observe the following rules:

1. Tests should be placed in the directory of the module they belong to.


2. Test under test/validation/... should be platform agnostic, i.e.
	-they should be written in plain C only
	-they may only used Clib functions, C_UNIT functions and of course ODP
	 functions.
	-they should be expected to pass on all ODP implementation

   Tests that do not follow these rules should be placed in the platform
   specific test area (currently platform/<platform>/test*)


3. If a new ODP API module is created, please update the Makefile.am and
   the odptest.h file


4. Respect the following name convention for the names exported in the library:

   * Tests, i.e. functions which are used in CUNIT test suites are named:
      *<Module>_test_*

   * Test arrays, i.e. arrays of CU_TestInfo, listing the test functions
    belonging to a suite, are called:
      <Module>_suite[_*]
    where the possible suffix can be used if many suites are declared.

   * CUNIT suite init and termination functions are called:
      <Module>_suite[_*]_init() and <Module>_suite[_*]_term()
    respectively.

   * Suite arrays, i.e. arrays of CU_SuiteInfo used in executables are called:
      <Module>_suites[_*]
    where the possible suffix identifies the executable using it, if many.

   * Main executable function(s), are called:
      <Module>_main[_*]*
    where the possible suffix identifies the executable using it

   * Init/term function for the whole executable are called:
      <Module>_init
      <Module>_term
