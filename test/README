Files in test/validation directory are intended to be terse checks that help
ensure that the ODP API Implementations all perform identically and to
specification. Tests inside the validation directory shall be platform
independent. However, they may need platform dependent environment
configuration.

To run valgrind on the executables do:
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --enable-test-vald --enable-valgrind
$ cd test/validation
$ make check-valgrind

Some tests scripts, like pktio require ODP_PLATFORM variable to be exported to load
platform specific env files. 'make check' defines that variable automatically,
and package will put all required files at the same place as tests binaries. But if
you run tests manually from odp source code then you need it to be defined, like:
export ODP_PLATFROM=linux-generic.
